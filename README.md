# Book Data Scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts book details from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/), a website for practicing web scraping. The script uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data and saves it in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features

- Scrapes book titles, star ratings, and prices from all available pages on the website.
- Handles pagination dynamically to ensure all pages are scraped.
- Saves the extracted data into a CSV file (`books1.csv`) using pandas.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas`

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
2. The script will scrape all pages from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) and save the book data in a CSV file named `books1.csv`.

## Output

The CSV file will contain the following columns:
- **Title**: The name of the book.
- **Star Rating**: The rating of the book (e.g., "One", "Two", etc.).
- **Price**: The price of the book in GBP (£).

Example data:
| Title                                  | Star Rating | Price  |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| A Light in the Attic                   | Three       | 51.77  |
| Tipping the Velvet                     | One         | 53.74  |

## Notes
